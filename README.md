# DinVM
DinVM is a lightweight Threat Intelligence Virtual Machine installer for Linux Lite/Ubuntu. It automatically sets up OSINT tools, malware analysis utilities, AI-assisted TI capabilities, Tor integration, OpenCTI-ready services, and analyst workflows using a single script. Inspired by FlareVM/Buscador but optimized for TI analysts.
